I think Iâ€™m a person who always has a can-do attitude and tends to take ownership proactively. These are the two personal attributes that made me stand out from my peers. 

Can-do attitude: When I was doing one of my internships, I was told to lead an expert call in medical beauty which was an industry I have never investigated before. I proactively took over the work and carried out careful preparations. Firstly, I reached out to colleagues for some previous research. Secondly, I caught up with latest market insights through public and private sources. In the end, I drafted 20+ industry and company specific questions which received very high remarks from my supervisor and successfully led the phone call to widen sector knowledge and seek potential investment opportunities for the fund.

Take ownership proactively: This means to be responsible for quality and outcome of work. For instance, I always triple check my work before handing it in and am aware to prepare backups whenever needed. I think it is very vital to remain responsive and accountable especially in banking and that is how you proceed to the next level and make progress in your career.

Well-rounded interpersonal and communicational skills: This can be illustrated by my exchange experience in UCB when I collaborated with students from various countries to accomplish a final project in a limited time period and made presentation to the guest lecturer. In banking, there are different entities such as lawyers, auditors, regulators and most importantly, our clients so that creating a comfortable vibe is quite essential during daily work. 

As for the weakness, I would say sometimes I got stuck in the details and could not see the big picture. However, I did make some adjustments including updating with my supervisors more regularly for his advice and summarizing key findings with bullet points at the front of the materials. If you can get a big picture and know the purpose of your work, you can definitely save a lot of time refining your output later which is quite helpful since in banking you have multiple deadlines in a single day.
