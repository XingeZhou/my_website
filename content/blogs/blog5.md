description: Stocks just had their best day since March. It was starting to seem like investors had cabin fever, given it’s been 29 trading days since the S&P 500’s last new record close – the longest such streak since autumn of 2020.

title: Key themes to watch during Q3 earnings season
---
Before we dig into our thoughts on earnings, we would be remiss not to address the most notable data release of the week: September inflation figures. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) print came in close to what was expected: Headline CPI was +5.4% year-over-year, and Core CPI was +4.0% year-over-year. From August to September, core rose only 0.2%—more in-line with “normal” versus the eye-popping prints we saw over the summer.

The notable thing about this month’s report is that it showed the drivers of inflation are starting to broaden out. Car prices (+1.3% month-over-month) are still being squeezed by the semiconductor shortage, while other reopening pressures in areas such as transportation services (-0.5%) and hotels (-0.6%) actually eased. But other, stickier areas such as owners’ equivalent rent (+0.4%) picked up in September by more than what we saw at any point in the last cycle.

That might be read as a sign that the tradeoff between “transitory” inflation pressures and more persistent ones is happening faster than expected, and parts of the market have reacted accordingly. The two-year Treasury yield, for example, headed into Friday at 0.36%, up +6 basis points (bps) versus a week ago, and +14 bps versus a month ago. Ten-year yields have dropped -10 bps to 1.51% since last Friday. The market-priced fed funds rate for the end of 2022 has crept higher, and is signaling at least one rate hike next year.

At this time, we’re not changing our base case assumption that the first hike won’t come until 2023. But we think this cycle will be marked by stronger growth and stronger inflation than the last, and the tail risk of the Federal Reserve hiking sooner is growing. Even so, our Equity Strategists think there’s still plenty of room for rates to rise before they would challenge our optimistic outlook for stocks. That outlook is based on our belief in the strength of earnings momentum, and the third-quarter earnings season that kicked off this week will offer a gut check on that.
