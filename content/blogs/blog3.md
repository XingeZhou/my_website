What Is ESG? ESG is the concept that many factors outside traditional financial analysis can be used to assess a company and its performance. Each letter represents a different area to examine.

Environmental: carbon emissions, waste management, water usage, and energy efficiency, for example

Social: customer satisfaction, data privacy, workplace health and safety, and employees’ healthcare access, among others

Governance: compensation practices, board composition, internal control processes, lobbying, and so on

Companies may outline or disclose their ESG efforts in various documents—from corporate responsibility publications to annual reports. JPMorgan Chase published its first annual report detailing the firm’s ESG work in 2015. The firm has issued annual reports every year since.

Hundreds of ESG raters use publicly available data to assess your business and share the results with the public and investors. ESG disclosure also gives you the chance to tell your company’s story. While you can’t directly control your ESG score, you can shape your company’s narrative by connecting your core ESG values to how you do business.

“While ESG raters are a factor to consider, we look to a variety of stakeholders to provide input on our ESG strategy,” Buchanan said.
