title: Energy prices are soaring. Should you be worried?

Oil prices are likewise climbing higher, and altogether the surge has majorly poked the big inflation bear. Eurozone headline inflation just came in at a 13-year high, and investors are questioning how long it will last, what it means, and what the policy response might be.

How did this even happen?In short, a whole lotta supply issues, mostly out of Europe. The combination of a cold winter and import disruptions in Russia and Norway (which produce about half of Europe’s gas) has chipped Europe’s stockpiles away to their lowest seasonal levels in more than a decade.

At the same time, other energy alternatives have gotten squeezed. Wind turbines slowed unexpectedly from a still summer. Coal got pinched amid already low supply from European mines and high demand from China. And in the case of oil, OPEC producers haven’t been meeting their production targets.

Last, a shift toward climate-friendlier policies has made “traditional” energy commodities with a larger carbon footprint—such as coal, oil and natural gas—more expensive.

But we have some good news. This energy crisis doesn’t spell doom for our positive outlook on the expansion.

At least one key player is already moving to mitigate the pain. Russia (again, a big gas supplier) has said it will send more than it’s contractually supposed to this year (which helped lead to some respite in the price spike during the latter half of this week—UK natural gas prices have fallen -9% over the last two days).
Growth is a lot less reliant on energy than in years past. The energy intensity of the U.S. economy (GDP generated per unit of oil) is down by a whopping 70% since the 1970s.

Governments seem willing to step in to bear some of these costs, suggesting help could be on the way for plagued suppliers, and the full brunt of it is less likely to be passed on to consumers. The EU has already promised to revise market rules around energy prices before the end of the year, as well as to telegraph measures such as tax cuts and state aid.

The surge shouldn’t put too much pressure on consumers. Americans only spend about 3% of their after-tax incomes on gas (though the biggest impact would be felt by the lowest income earners). Such spending is similarly low in Europe—gas, electricity, and fuel account for 2.5% of U.K. and 3.8% of Eurozone consumer spending. Not to mention consumer balance sheets are still flush with cash.
